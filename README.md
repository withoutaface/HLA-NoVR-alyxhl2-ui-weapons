NoVR Script for Half-Life: Alyx

Mod repository note: due to regular (and huge) NoVR main mod changes, I'm constantly updating this repo by manually making reset to clear state, and applying all mod support changes again.

## Mod support
With this fork of NoVR mod, you will be able to also play & complete next modifications (you can get them from Steam Workshop):
- ``Levitation`` (campaign, 7 maps + intro)
- ``Extra-Ordinary Value`` (campaign, 4 maps) 
- ``Belomorskaya Station`` (1 map)
- ``Overcharge`` (1 map)
- ``Red Dust`` (1 map)

## Installation
Copy the ``game`` folder into your main Half-Life: Alyx installation folder (e.g. ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx``).

## Playing
Start the game with the launch options ``-novr -vsync``.

You can also get the NoVR Map Edits addon for smoother traversal and less out of bounds glitches: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2956743603

## Controls
To change the controls/rebind buttons, edit ``game\hlvr\scripts\vscripts\bindings.lua`` in your main Half-Life: Alyx installation folder.
