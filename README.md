# HLA-NoVR + alyxhl2 ui and weapons
NoVR Script for Half-Life: Alyx

## alyxhl2 ui and weapons
Addon adds a custom ui, alyx font and viewmodels for the pistol and shotgun.
(The ui was adapted and merged in the base hla novr repository - source files can be found in subfolder alyxhl2_ui_source_files) 
Viewmodel for the pistol was created by myself, the shotgun viewmodel is ported from source1 by author [Just Kris](https://gamebanana.com/mods/243462) 

Please note that the viewmodels are work-in-progress - Enjoy!

## Install alyxhl2 weapon viewmodels
