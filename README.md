## Installation
Copy the ``game`` folder into your main Half-Life: Alyx installation folder (e.g. ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx``).

## Playing
Start the game with the launch options ``-novr -vsync``. For the best experience, when starting a new game choose "PLAY WITH ADDONS", so the maps will be optimized to prevent glitches.

## Controls
To change the controls/rebind buttons, edit ``game\hlvr\scripts\vscripts\bindings.lua`` in your main Half-Life: Alyx installation folder.
