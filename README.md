# HLA-NoVR
NoVR Script for Half-Life: Alyx

## Installation
Copy the ``game`` folder into your main Half-Life: Alyx installation folder (e.g. ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx``).

## Playing
Start the game with the launch options ``-novr -vsync``. For the best experience, when starting a new game choose "PLAY WITH ADDONS", so the maps will be optimized to prevent glitches.
